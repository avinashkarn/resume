Background
==========

I am a first class honours graduate in computer engineering, a master's
student in bioinformatics, a computer and electronics enthusiast, an
open-source software advocate, an avid traveller, a climber, a singer
and an experimental amateur chef. I have eleven years of industry
experience developing software in C++, C and assembly, including five
years developing high-performance distributed and parallel algorithms
for genome sequence assembly, and six years developing embedded and
real-time control systems. I have extensive experience developing
portable software for POSIX systems such as GNU/Linux and Mac OS X.
When developing performance-critical software, I understand the
hardware from the transistor up.

Education
=========

2012–present — MSc Bioinformatics
---------------------------------
### University of British Columbia

NSERC CGS-M scholarship student in bioinformatics. GPA 4.26 (93%)

1998–2004 — BASc (First Class Hons.) Computer Eng.
--------------------------------------------------
### Simon Fraser University

Scholarship student in Computer Engineering. Completed an honours
undergraduate thesis and two full years of co-op work experience at
three companies. GPA 3.85

Work Experience
===============

2008–2012 — Computational biologist
-------------------------------------------
### BC Cancer Agency Genome Sciences Centre

Developed the genome sequence assembly software package, ABySS. This
heavily parallel and distributed software system, which uses MPI,
pthread and OpenMP for parallel computation, was the first system to
assemble a human genome using short-read sequencing technology.

2004–2007 — Embedded firmware developer
-----------------------------------------------
### Pathway Connectivity Inc.

Developed the firmware for Pathway's product line of small, low-cost
lighting control devices. These DIN-rail-mounted devices, which use
Atmel's AVR microcontroller, convert between a variety of
lighting-control protocols including DMX512, analog, PWM and contact
closure. Modernized the lighting control industry by developing a
novel piece of equipment, the Pathport, to adapt legacy lighting
control equipment to Ethernet. This industry-changing product won an
award for best new product at the industry trade show, Lighting
Dimensions International.

Volunteer Experience
====================

2002–present — Debian developer
---------------------------------------

Maintain open-source software packages for the Debian distribution
of GNU/Linux. Member of the Debian Med team, which maintains a
menagerie of bioinformatics software.
