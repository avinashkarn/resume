PhD Student Bioinformatics, BASc (First Class Hons.) Computer Engineering

Background
==========

I am a PhD student in bioinformatics, a first class honours graduate
in computer engineering, a computer and electronics enthusiast, an
open-source software developer and advocate, an avid traveller, a
hiker, a singer and an experimental amateur chef. I have twelve years
of industry and academic experience developing software in C++ and a
variety of scripting languages, including six years developing
high-performance distributed and parallel algorithms for genome
sequence assembly, and six years developing embedded and real-time
control systems. I have extensive experience developing portable
software for POSIX systems such as GNU/Linux and Mac OS X. When
developing performance-critical software, I understand the hardware
from the transistor up.

Education
=========

2012–present — PhD Student Bioinformatics
-----------------------------------------

### University of British Columbia

NSERC CGS-M and CGS-D scholarship student in bioinformatics. Coursework
in bioinformatics, statistics, machine learning and genetics.
GPA 4.26 (93%)

1998–2004 — BASc (First Class Hons.) Computer Engineering
---------------------------------------------------------

### Simon Fraser University

Scholarship student in computer engineering. Completed an honours
undergraduate thesis and two full years of co-op work experience at
three companies. GPA 3.85

Work Experience
===============

2008–2012 — Computational biologist
-------------------------------------------

### BC Cancer Agency Genome Sciences Centre

Developed the genome sequence assembly software package, ABySS. This
heavily parallel and distributed software system, which uses both MPI
and OpenMP for parallel computation, was the first system to assemble
a human genome using short-read sequencing technology.

2004–2007 — Embedded firmware developer
-----------------------------------------------

### Pathway Connectivity Inc.

Developed the firmware for Pathway's product line of small, low-cost
lighting control devices. These small devices, which use Atmel's AVR
and ARM microcontrollers, convert between a variety of
lighting-control protocols including DMX512, analog, PWM and contact
closure. Modernized the lighting control industry in developing a
device, the Pathport, to adapt legacy lighting control equipment to
Ethernet. This industry-changing product won an award for best new
product at the industry trade show, Lighting Dimensions International.

2002 May — Co-op work experience
--------------------------------

### Vortek Industries Ltd.

Worked on the rapid thermal processing tool used in the manufacturing
of semiconductor devices. Developed the temperature sensor and lamp
power control system using the QNX real-time operating system.

Volunteer Experience
====================

2002–present — Open-source developer
------------------------------------

Maintain open-source bioinformatics software packages for the Mac OS
package manager, Homebrew-science, and the Debian distribution of
GNU/Linux.
