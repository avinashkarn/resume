Background
==========

I am a first class honours graduate in computer engineering, a masters
student in bioinformatics, a computer and electronics enthusiast, an
open-source software advocate, an avid traveller, a climber, a singer
and an experimental amateur chef. I have ten years of industry
experience developing software in C++, C and assembly, including four
years developing high-performance distributed and parallel algorithms
for genome sequence assembly, and six years developing embedded and
real-time control systems. I have extensive experience developing
portable software for POSIX systems such as GNU/Linux and Mac OS X.
When developing performance-critical software, I understand the
hardware from the transistor up.

Work Experience
===============

2008–2012 — Computational biologist
-------------------------------------------
**BC Cancer Agency Genome Sciences Centre**

Developed the genome sequence assembly software package, ABySS. This
heavily parallel and distributed software system, which uses MPI,
pthread and OpenMP for parallel computation, was the first system to
assemble a human genome using short-read sequencing technology.

2004–2007 — Embedded firmware developer
-----------------------------------------------
**Pathway Connectivity Inc.**

Developed the firmware for Pathway's product line of small, low-cost
lighting control devices. These DIN-rail-mounted devices, which use
Atmel's AVR microcontroller, convert between a variety of
lighting-control protocols including DMX512, analog, PWM and contact
closure. Modernized the lighting control industry by developing a
novel piece of equipment, the Pathport, to adapt legacy lighting
control equipment to Ethernet. This industry-changing product won an
award for best new product at the industry trade show, Lighting
Dimensions International.

2002 May–Aug — Co-op work experience
--------------------------------------------
**Vortek Industries Ltd.**

Worked on the rapid thermal processing tool used in the manufacturing
of semiconductor devices. Developed the temperature sensor and lamp
power control system using the QNX real-time operating system.

Volunteer Experience
====================

2002–present — Debian developer
---------------------------------------

Maintain open-source software packages for the Debian distribution
of GNU/Linux. Member of the Debian Med team, which maintains a
menagerie of bioinformatics software.

Scholarship student in Computer Engineering. Completed an honours
undergraduate thesis and two full years of co-op work experience at
three companies. GPA 3.85.
