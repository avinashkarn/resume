<h1>Shaun Jackman</h1>

<p>PhD Student Bioinformatics, BASc (First Class Hons.) Computer Engineering</p>

<h1>Background</h1>

<p>I am a PhD student in bioinformatics, a first class honours graduate
in computer engineering, a computer and electronics enthusiast, an
open-source software developer and advocate, an avid traveller, a
hiker, a singer and an experimental amateur chef. I have twelve years
of industry and academic experience developing software in C++ and a
variety of scripting languages, including six years developing
high-performance distributed and parallel algorithms for genome
sequence assembly, and six years developing embedded and real-time
control systems. I have extensive experience developing portable
software for POSIX systems such as GNU/Linux and Mac OS X. When
developing performance-critical software, I understand the hardware
from the transistor up.</p>

<h1>Education</h1>

<h2>2012–present — PhD Student Bioinformatics</h2>

<h3>University of British Columbia</h3>

<p>NSERC CGS-M and CGS-D scholarship student in bioinformatics. Coursework
in bioinformatics, statistics, machine learning and genetics.
GPA 4.26 (93%)</p>

<h2>1998–2004 — BASc (First Class Hons.) Computer Engineering</h2>

<h3>Simon Fraser University</h3>

<p>Scholarship student in computer engineering. Completed an honours
undergraduate thesis and two full years of co-op work experience at
three companies. GPA 3.85</p>

<h1>Work Experience</h1>

<h2>2008–2012 — Computational biologist</h2>

<h3>BC Cancer Agency Genome Sciences Centre</h3>

<p>Developed the genome sequence assembly software package, ABySS. This
heavily parallel and distributed software system, which uses both MPI
and OpenMP for parallel computation, was the first system to assemble
a human genome using short-read sequencing technology.</p>

<h2>2004–2007 — Embedded firmware developer</h2>

<h3>Pathway Connectivity Inc.</h3>

<p>Developed the firmware for Pathway's product line of small, low-cost
lighting control devices. These small devices, which use Atmel's AVR
and ARM microcontrollers, convert between a variety of
lighting-control protocols including DMX512, analog, PWM and contact
closure. Modernized the lighting control industry in developing a
device, the Pathport, to adapt legacy lighting control equipment to
Ethernet. This industry-changing product won an award for best new
product at the industry trade show, Lighting Dimensions International.</p>

<h2>2002 May — Co-op work experience</h2>

<h3>Vortek Industries Ltd.</h3>

<p>Worked on the rapid thermal processing tool used in the manufacturing
of semiconductor devices. Developed the temperature sensor and lamp
power control system using the QNX real-time operating system.</p>

<h1>Volunteer Experience</h1>

<h2>2002–present — Open-source developer</h2>

<p>Maintain open-source bioinformatics software packages for the Mac OS
package manager, Homebrew-science, and the Debian distribution of
GNU/Linux.</p>
